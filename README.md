# ML-SVM
Support Vector Machines

Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm has been implemented for training Support Vector Machines (SVM) on the MNIST data set. Since the data is not linearly separable, is is projected to a higher dimensional space and to avoid data over fitting, slack variables (soft margin) are introdoced.
